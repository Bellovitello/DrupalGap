A Foundation 6 based theme.

1. Download Foundation 6: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download/assets/complete-f6.zip
2. Extract the `css`, `img` and `js` directories into the app

The file system will look something like this:

```
index.html      # DrupalGap's default index.html file
css/            # Foundation 6 CSS
img/            # Foundation 6 Images
js/             # Foundation 6 JavaScript
...             # A bunch of other files...
```

3. Copy the contents of the `default.index.html` file from this theme's folder, and replace the contents of the
 `index.html` file with it.
