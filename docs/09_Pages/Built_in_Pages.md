DrupalGap comes prepackaged with many pages that can automatically be displayed in a mobile application. For example, we know our Drupal websites come with the following pages:

- Node Pages
- Node Edit Form
- User Login
- User Registration
- User Profile Pages
- User Account Edit Form
- Taxonomy Term Pages
- Taxonomy Term Edit Form

So it makes sense to have these same types of pages available withour mobile applications.

## Node Pages

Before displaying a node in our mobile application, we need to set up the [Display Mode](../Entities/Display_Modes) on our node's content type. This allows us to control what fields and labels show up for our content type.

It is possible to override a node's page, and completely customize how it looks.
