DrupalGap comes with a CLI (command line interface) that includes a set of handy
terminal commands to automate typical DrupalGap development needs.

# Setup

The command needs executable permissions:

```
cd drupalgap-sdk-root
chmod +x drupalgap
```
A typical command has the following format, with any number of optional
arguments.

```
./drupalgap [command] [arg1] [arg2] [arg...] 
```
