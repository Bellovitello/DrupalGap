> DrupalGap has two parts...

 - [Drupal Module](https://drupal.org/project/drupalgap)
 - [Application Development Kit](https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap)

The Drupal Module opens up communication between an application and a Drupal 8 website. The application development kit is used by developers to create custom mobile applications, and web applications.

> How does the module work?

The DrupalGap module utilizes [Drupal 8 REST](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/rest) to help applications communicate with a Drupal 8 website using [JSON](http://www.json.org/).

> How does the app development kit work?

The DrupalGap application development kit uses [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) to build the user interface, and uses [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) to compile the app for installation as a mobile application on devices.
